This project can be run using the command "python main.py"  This will initialize
a local instance of the web app running on port 5001.

This project is built on python 2.7 and leverages the following packages:

Flask == 0.11.1
requests == 2.11.1

and the default url lib.

This project only depends upon a number of javascript libraries which are

knockoutjs
jquery

This project also depends on the usage of google maps api as well as the yelp v3 api.

In the event of a failed yelp api call the program will continue to function and instead display default additional marker information.
